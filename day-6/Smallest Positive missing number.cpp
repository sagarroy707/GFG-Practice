/*
1. Since we have to find the smallest missing +ve element and the size is n
2. missing number should lie in domain [1,n+1].

 

    In first loop:
    1. whenever we encounter a +ve number we check that if number is in domain [1, n]. 
    2. if number is in domain, we place it at its correct position (if the current number is duplicate then we don't place it and move on).
    3. we swap the number with number at index number-1

 

    At last, number n must be present at index n-1, n > 0

 

    In second loop, we check if the number at index i doesn't equal to i+1, we return i+1 as it is the missing number.

 

    if we don't find number in second loop then it means that all numbers in domain [1, n] are present.
